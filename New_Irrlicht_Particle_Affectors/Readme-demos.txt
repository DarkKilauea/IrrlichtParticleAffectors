1. How to start
==========================================================================

Simply unzip the contents of the zip file anywhere.  You can take a look at the
precompiled demos in /release.  The source files for the demos can be found in
each of the demos' respective directories.

==========================================================================
2. Requirements
==========================================================================
You will need irrlicht 1.4.1 and the minimal package of my affectors in order to
compile all the demos.  Instructions on compiling the minimal package into irrlicht 
1.4.1 can be found in the minimal package's Readme file.

You can get the minimal package by following the link in this forum post:

Only the scale affector demo requires the minimal package to be installed.  The other
affectors should work fine with irrlicht 1.4 and above.
